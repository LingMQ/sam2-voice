## Your Unique Value Propositions

### 1. Micro-Feedback Loop (Primary Differentiator)

No competitor offers real-time, voice-based micro-reinforcement. This addresses the core ADHD challenge—dysregulated internal feedback—directly.

### 2. Voice-First + Always Available

Unlike scheduled services (Focusmate, FLOWN), sam2-voice is instantly accessible when executive function is lowest.

### 3. Self-Improving Personalization

W&B Weave integration allows the agent to learn what works for each user over time—no competitor does this.

### 4. ABA Integration

Applied Behavior Analysis techniques are clinically validated for autism support. No consumer app integrates this.

### 5. Open/Hackable

Unlike closed apps, sam2-voice can be customized, extended, and self-hosted.
